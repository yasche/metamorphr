\usage{
plot_pca(
  data,
  method = "svd",
  what = "scores",
  n_pcs = 2,
  pcs = c(1, 2),
  center = TRUE,
  group_column = NULL,
  name_column = NULL,
  return_tbl = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A tidy tibble created by \code{\link[metamorphr]{read_featuretable}}.}

\item{method}{A character specifying one of the available methods ("svd", "nipals", "rnipals", "bpca", "ppca", "svdImpute", "robustPca", "nlpca", "llsImpute", "llsImputeAll"). If the default is used ("svd") an SVD PCA will be done, in case \code{data} does not contain missing values, or a NIPALS PCA if \code{data} does contain missing values.}

\item{what}{Specifies what should be returned. Either \code{"scores"} or \code{"loadings"}.}

\item{n_pcs}{The number of PCs to calculate.}

\item{pcs}{A vector containing 2 integers that specifies the PCs to plot. The following condition applies: \code{max(pcs) <= n_pcs}.}

\item{center}{Should \code{data} be mean centered? See \code{\link[pcaMethods]{prep}} for details.}

\item{group_column}{Either \code{NULL} or a column in \code{data} (e.g., \code{group_column = Group}). If provided, the dots in the scores plot will be colored according to their group. Only relevant if \code{what = "scores"}.}

\item{name_column}{Either \code{NULL} or a column in \code{data} (e.g., \code{name_column = Feature}). If provided, feature names are preserved in the resulting tibble. Only relevant if \code{what = "loadings"} & \code{return_tbl = TRUE}.}

\item{return_tbl}{A logical. If \code{FALSE}, returns a ggplot2 object, if \code{TRUE} returns a tibble which can be used to draw the plot manually to have more control.}

\item{verbose}{Should outputs from \code{\link[pcaMethods]{pca}} be printed to the console?}
}
\value{
Either a Scores or Loadings Plot in the form of a ggplot2 object or a tibble.
}
\description{
Performs PCA and creates a Scores or Loadings plot. Basically a wrapper around \verb{pcaMethods::}\code{\link[pcaMethods]{pca}}
The plot is drawn with \if{html}{\out{<a href = "https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">}}ggplot2\if{html}{\out{</a>}} and can therefore be easily manipulated afterwards (e.g., changing the theme or the axis labels).
Please note that the function is intended to be easy to use and beginner friendly and therefore offers limited ability to fine-tune certain parameters of the resulting plot.
If you wish to draw the plot yourself, you can set \code{return_tbl = TRUE}. In this case, a tibble is returned instead of a ggplot2 object which you can use to create a plot yourself.

\if{html}{\out{<b>}}Important Note\if{html}{\out{</b>}}\if{html}{\out{<br>}}
\code{plot_pca()} depends on the \code{pcaMethods} package from Bioconductor. If \code{metamorphr} was installed via \code{install.packages()}, dependencies from Bioconductor were not
automatically installed. When \code{plot_pca()} is called without the \code{pcaMethods} package installed, you should be asked if you want to install \code{pak} and \code{pcaMethods}.
If you want to use \code{plot_pca()} you have to install those. In case you run into trouble with the automatic installation, please install \code{pcaMethods} manually. See
\if{html}{\out{<a href = "https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pcaMethods.html">}}pcaMethods â€“ a Bioconductor package providing PCA methods for incomplete data.\if{html}{\out{</a>}} for instructions on manual installation.
