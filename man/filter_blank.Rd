\title{Filter Features based on their occurrence in blank samples}
\usage{
filter_blank(data, blank_samples, blank_as_group = FALSE, min_frac = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A tidy tibble created by \code{\link[metamorphr]{read_featuretable}}.}

\item{blank_samples}{Defines the blanks. If \code{blank_as_group = FALSE} a character vector containing the names of the blank samples
as in the \code{Sample} column of \code{data}. If \code{blank_as_group = TRUE} the name(s) of the group(s) that define blanks, as in the \code{Group} column of \code{data}.
The latter can only be used if sample metadata is provided.}

\item{blank_as_group}{A logical indicating if \code{blank_samples} are the names of samples or group(s).}

\item{min_frac}{A numeric defining how many times higher the maximum intensity in samples must be in relation to blanks.}
}
\value{
A filtered tibble.
}
\description{
One of several filter functions. It filters Features based on their occurrence in blank samples.
For example, if \code{min_frac = 3} the maximum intensity in samples must be at least 3 times as high as in blanks
for a Feature not to be filtered out.

\examples{
#Example 1: Define blanks by sample name

#Example 2: Define blanks by group name

  filter_blank(blank_samples = "blank", blank_as_group = TRUE, min_frac = 3)
