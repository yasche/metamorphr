\title{Group-based feature filtering}
\usage{
filter_grouped_mv(data, grouping_column, min_found, fraction = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A tidy tibble created by \code{\link[metamorphr]{read_featuretable}} with added sample metadata. See ?\code{\link[metamorphr]{create_metadata_skeleton}} for help.}

\item{grouping_column}{Which column should be used for grouping? Uses \code{\link[rlang]{args_data_masking}}.}

\item{min_found}{Defines in how many samples of at least 1 group a Feature must be found not to be filtered out. If \code{fraction == TRUE}, a value between 0 and 1 (\emph{e.g.}, 0.5 if a Feature must be found in at least half the samples of at least 1 group). If \code{fraction == FALSE} the absolute maximum number of samples (\emph{e.g.}, 5 if a specific Feature must be found in at least 5 samples of at least 1 group).}

\item{fraction}{Either \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}. Should \code{min_found} be the absolute number of samples or a fraction?}
}
\value{
A filtered tibble.
}
\description{
One of several filter functions. Similar to \code{filter_global_mv()} it filters features that are found in a specified number of samples.
The key difference is that \code{filter_grouped_mv()} takes groups into consideration and therefore needs sample metadata.
For example, if \code{fraction = TRUE} and \code{min_found = 0.75}, a feature must be found in at least 75 \% of the samples of at least 1 group.
It is very similar to the \emph{Filter features by occurrences in groups} option in Bruker MetaboScape.
