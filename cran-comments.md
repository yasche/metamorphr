## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added all relevant references to the DESCRIPTION file.

* Replaced cat() with rlang::inform().

* Removed every call to print(). Upon closer inspection, the print()ed information appeared to be unnecessary.


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
