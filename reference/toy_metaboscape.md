# A small toy data set created from a feature table in MetaboScape style

The raw feature table is also included. This tibble can be reproduced
with
`metamorphr::read_featuretable(system.file("extdata", "toy_metaboscape.csv", package = "metamorphr"), metadata_cols = 2:5)`.

## Usage

``` r
toy_metaboscape
```

## Format

### `toy_metaboscape`

A data frame with 110 rows and 8 columns:

- UID:

  A unique identifier for each Feature. This column is automatically
  generated by
  [`metamorphr::read_featuretable()`](https://yasche.github.io/metamorphr/reference/read_featuretable.md)
  when the feature table is imported.

- Feature:

  A label given to each Feature for easier identification. The column of
  the original feature table that is used to generate the Feature column
  is specified with the `label_col` argument of
  [`metamorphr::read_featuretable()`](https://yasche.github.io/metamorphr/reference/read_featuretable.md).

- Sample:

  Sample name. Column names in the original feature table.

- Intensity:

  Measured intensity (or area).

- RT:

  Retention time. Feature metadata and therefore not really necessary.

- m/z:

  Mass over charge. Feature metadata and therefore not really necessary.

- Name:

  Feature name. Feature metadata and therefore not really necessary.

- Formula:

  Chemical formula. Feature metadata and therefore not really necessary.
